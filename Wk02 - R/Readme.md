# Overview

In this module I decided to learn R and use new libraries.

# Development Environment

I decided to predict stocks that my wife and I have bought when we got married. I tried to track them using tidyquaint and tidyverse. I also used dygraphs to produce beautiful sliding graphs. Learning how to use the forecast library was fun. Not only did it help me visualize what my stock picks look like in the future, it also helped me troubleshoot my VScode environment.

# Useful Websites

- [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)
- [Forecast](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/index.html)

# Future Work

- Incorporate a csv / text file to list stock picks
- Create a better looking graph for forecasting
