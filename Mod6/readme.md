# Overview

I having an extreme case of senioritis right now so I'm not sure I still want to do this.

The purpose behind creating this software was to delve deeper into Kotlin's syntax and apply it in an Android app context. It serves as a hands-on project to solidify my knowledge of handling UI elements, user interactions, and data management in an Android environment using Kotlin.

# Development Environment

For this project, Android Studio was the primary tool used for development. Android Studio provides an excellent environment for Android app creation, offering various built-in tools for layout design, code debugging, and testing.
I used Kotlin which has become the preferred language for Android app development. No additional libraries were utilized this basic implementation.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, several websites provided valuable insights and guidance:

- [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs): Official documentation offering comprehensive guides and references for Android app development.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): A helpful community-driven platform where developers share knowledge and troubleshoot issues.
- [Kotlin Official Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html): Kotlin's official documentation offering detailed explanations of the language features and usage.

# Future Work

Needs a lot ok work. Like a lot.
