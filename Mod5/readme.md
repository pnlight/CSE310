# Overview

In this module, I've created an address locator and decoder using JavaScript, leveraging the Google Maps API for address decoding. While the code isn't directly compatible with ArcGIS Pro, the Google API integration can aid in address location within that platform.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using:

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript, Node.js
- **Libraries:** Google Maps API

# Useful Websites

- [Google Maps API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)
- [MDN Web Docs for JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# Future Work

- Improve error handling for cases where the address isn't found
- Enhance UI for better user interaction
- Implement autocomplete for the address input field
- Use github action secrets to secure the API key
